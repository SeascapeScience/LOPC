# LOPC
Matlab code for reading, manipulating, and plotting data from the Laser Optical Plankton Counter

These functions are kind of crude right now. I'm hoping to improve that. Meanwhile, I've heard that that LOPC instrument is discontinued. Hopefully this code will be useful for interpreting historical LOPC data.
